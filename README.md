# mySeed
An open source project to encrypt its BIP39 seed phrase.
Of course, other security measures such as using an offline PC should be taken into account. And this is definitely not for people with entire Bitcoins in their wallet. And at the latest when Bitcoin rises to 100,000 USD, fractional Bitcoiners should also consider whether they want to continue on this path. But as a beginner, I feel sufficiently secure with this free tool before I spend more money on security measures than I own Bitcoin.&nbsp;

I am not an expert in the field of encryption and would be grateful for any expert who would look for major errors here.&nbsp;

Operation manual:&nbsp;

Write your 12 or 24 words in order in the upper “Seed” boxes. All fields must have a white background. A red background indicates an input error. Either you made a typo or the word you used is not in the BIP39 word list. Once all words have been entered correctly, you can enter a password. The data displayed in “Your code” can now only be calculated back using the password. It is best to save this data on multiple media. The password used should ideally only be known to you and trusted people, but if possible not and under no circumstances should it be stored together with the encrypted data.\r\nTo restore your seed phrase you need the encrypted code, password and program. Enter the password and then copy the previously saved code into the same field from which you previously took it. Your seed phrase will then be displayed in the fields below. Don't forget to secure the program itself or its installation material as well as the encrypted code and password.
